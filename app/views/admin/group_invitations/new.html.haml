%p 
  This is a quick way to bring a group of people into the system in one go. 
  Enter a comma-separated list of names and email addresses below (one person per line) 
  and each of those people will be invited into the system and issued an account with a vaguely adequate username 
  and entirely random password. Anyone who is already here will just be added to the group.

- if message = @group.messages.for_function('invitation').first
  %p

      You may want to check the group's
      = link_to "invitation message", admin_message_url(message)
      before going any further.

    .form-area

          title or rank, 
        name, email, [login], [phone]
        %br
        = text_area_tag "readerlist", params[:readerlist], :class => "textarea", :style => "width: 100%; height: 240px;"

      %p.buttons
        = submit_tag 'preview import', :class => 'button'
        or
        = link_to "Cancel", admin_group_url(@group)

      %p
        When you press the 'preview import' button, the list will be repeated back to you to show exactly what reader accounts we are going to create and/or invite into this group. 
        You can make changes at that stage, but please check the list formatting carefully: be sure there are no commas other than where you want them and that the email addresses are correct.

    Before you can proceed, you will need to
    = link_to("create an invitation message", new_admin_group_message_url(@group, :function => 'invitation')) + '.'
    for this group.
