# Reader Group Extension

This extension introduces the reader group: a set of readers that can be given permission to access pages, forums, downloads and other public site content. It does not group your users or affect the admin interface (apart from adding a groups tab, of course).

## Status

Getting there. The core is all working and groups can be created and edited but I haven't brought across the more useful code for sending out messages to the whole group, batch-inviting people and generally managing large groups of site users.
