# Reader Group Extension

This extension introduces the reader group: a set of readers that can be given permission to access pages, forums, downloads and other public site content. It does not group your users or affect the admin interface (apart from adding a groups tab, of course).

## Status

Nearly ready. All the functionality is here but the interface could stand a bit of polish.

## Bugs and comments

In [lighthouse](http://spanner.lighthouseapp.com/projects/26912-radiant-extensions), please, or for little things an email or github message is always welcome.
