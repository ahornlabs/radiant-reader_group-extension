# Reader Group Extension

This extension introduces the reader group: a set of readers that can be given permission to access pages, forums, downloads and other public site content. It does not group your users or affect the admin interface (apart from adding a groups tab, of course).

## Status

Incomplete! I'm just bringing the machinery across into the Reader context one bit at a time. Right now the basic mechanisms are all working and the models are tested but there's no interface on it.
